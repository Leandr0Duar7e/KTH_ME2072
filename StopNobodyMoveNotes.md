# Summary of Main Theories from "Stop Nobody Move"

## 1. The Rabbit-Model
The Rabbit-Model is a central analogy used throughout the book to describe how digitalization impacts industries. Just as rabbits introduced to Australia disrupted the existing ecosystem, digital technologies fundamentally change industry landscapes. Key insights:
- Organizations need to "stop and assess" before acting, like Mira did in the Stockholm terror attack
- Creating a "map of the future" is crucial for navigation
- Success depends on finding "the right rabbit for the right Australia at the right time"
- The model helps analyze how your business will disrupt an industry and who will adopt it
- Digital transformation requires leadership, not just management

## 2. Disruptive Theory
The book explains how new technologies disrupt existing business networks through several mechanisms:
- Disruption often starts with unexpected customers that the industry doesn't see coming
- Initial adopters usually have very specific needs that aren't being met
- These solutions improve over time and attract mainstream customers
- Example: Early 3G phone adopters leading to widespread mobile internet adoption
- The process leads to fundamental shifts in industry structure

## 3. Diffusion of Innovation
The theory describes how new ideas and technologies spread through populations:
- Uses the Rogers adoption curve (innovators → early adopters → early majority → late majority → laggards)
- Understanding this curve helps "ride the wave" of disruption
- Early adopters must have specific, compelling needs
- Timing and targeting the right audience are crucial for success
- Digital transformation can accelerate adoption patterns

## 4. Dynamics of Innovation
The book explores how innovation evolves in cycles:
- Fight for dominance → cheapest option → new competitor replacement
- Innovations typically start in niche markets
- Constant adaptation is necessary as innovation never stops
- New competencies often replace old ones
- Business models must evolve with changing consumer expectations

- Embrace learning and adaptation
- View failure as an opportunity for growth

## Key Takeaways
